# Excel-Tracker-Templates

A set of trackers for timekeeping, metrics, and quality assurance I developed for my current position. Each of these trackers take semi-structured data and visualizes it in an intuitive and simple way for upper management to quickly parse. Each template pulls from a central "Dump" sheet where new data is pasted, and will automatically update the rest of the excel sheet. 

I have gotten these templates working in Google Sheets, but only after some tweaking. They are primarily desinged for Excel.
